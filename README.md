# Ising_model
implementation of ising model

The ising model is a toy model for interactions in statistical mechanics. Here it is used the hamiltonian

![\Large H = -J \sum_{i,j} s_i s_j](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}) 

$$H = -J \sum_{i,j} s_i s_j$$
