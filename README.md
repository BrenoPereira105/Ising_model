# Ising_model
implementation of ising model

The ising model is a toy model for interactions in statistical mechanics. Here it is used the hamiltonian

H = -J \sum_{i,j} s_i s_j - \sum_{i}h_i s_i

It is also considered periodic boundary conditions, T^2 = R^2/Z^2. For simplification, it is considered the system does not interact with external sources. Also the boltzmann constant \kappa and the interaction energy J are considered to be \kappa = J = 1.
